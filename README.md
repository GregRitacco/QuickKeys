## QuickKeys
A suite of TrainPlayer scripts that map train commands to the keyboard. The followings are the modules that make up QuickKeys.  
### QuickKeys  
This is the 'main' module that links the other modules together and provides language and help support.  
### SpeedSwitching  
A set of keyboard mappings to TrainPlayer train control commands. This is the module that 'drives' trains.  
Within SpeedSwitching is a module called PhakePhysics. This module extends the capabilities of SpeedSwitching by adding a set of controls not found in TrainPlayer. As its name implies, PhakePhysics adds mild physics simulations to the movement of trains. Additionally, keyboard keys are remapped to better simulate real train control functions such as throttle notch and automatic brake applications. This adds the same sort of challenge real engineers face while controlling trains to TrainPlayers layout environment.  
### DropKick  
This is another set of mappings that allows the operator to 'kick' and 'drop' rail cars in a manner very similar to real rail operations, and adds fun to basic switching operations. These functions are unique to this suite and are not found in TrainPlayer.  
### PhastPhunctions  
PhastPhunctions are a set of mappings that allow locomotives to be selected by pressing a function key. Thus, any one of ten locomotives on a layout can quickly be selected to run.  
### TurnTable  
This module extends TrainPlayers control of turntables and transfer tables. By using the keyboard, a turntables bridge can quickly be aligned to any stall or approach track.
